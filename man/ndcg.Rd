\title{Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)}
\usage{
ndcg(observed, predicted, proportion = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{(\code{numeric}) The observed values. It has to have the same
length as \code{predicted}.}

\item{predicted}{(\code{numeric}) The observed values. It has to have the same
length as \code{observed}.}

\item{proportion}{(\code{numeric(1)}) The proportion of top observations used to
compute the metric. 1 by default.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value with the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain.
}
\description{
Computes the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain on a proportion of top
observations.
}
\details{
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain is computed as:

\figure{ndcg.png}{dcg / idcg}

where y_i is the observed value of element i, hat{y_i} is the predicted
value of element i and k is the number of top observations specified in the
proportion parameter.
