\title{Stratified K-fold cross validation folds generation}
\usage{
cv_kfold_strata(data, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(\code{vector}) The categorical data considered to stratify the folds.}

\item{k}{(\code{numeric(1)}) The number of folds. 5 by default.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with \code{k} elements where each element is a named \code{list} with the
elements \code{training} wich includes the indices of those records to be part of
the training set and \code{testing} wich includes the indices of those records to
be part of the testing set. Training and testing sets of each fold are
exhaustive and mutually exclusive.
}
\description{
Generates folds for the stratified k-fold cross validation where k mutually
exclusive folds are generated and the training phase is done using k âˆ’ 1
folds and the testing with the remaining one, which ensures all individuals
are part of the testing once. Given a categorical variable this type of cross
validation ensures each fold contains the same proportion of elements of each
class, so it is a good option for balanced folds.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generates 5 folds of 2 elements (10 / 5) in testing set
data <- c(rep("A", 10), rep("B", 20), rep("C", 30))
folds <- cv_kfold_strata(data, 5)
# Indices of training set in fold 1
folds[[1]]$training
# Indices of testing set in fold 1
folds[[1]]$testing
# Verify fold 1 is balanced in training
table(data[folds[[1]]$training])
# Verify fold 1 is balanced in testing
table(data[folds[[1]]$testing])
#' # Verify fold 2 is balanced in training
table(data[folds[[2]]$training])
# Verify fold 2 is balanced in testing
table(data[folds[[2]]$testing])

folds <- cv_kfold_strata(iris$Species, 30)
# List with indices of training and testing of fold 1
folds[[1]]
# List with indices of training and testing of fold 2
