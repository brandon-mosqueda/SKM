\usage{
partial_least_squares(
  x,
  y,
  method = "kernel",
  components_num = NULL,
  scale = FALSE,
  validate_params = TRUE,
  seed = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{matrix}) The predictor (independet) variable(s). It must be a
numeric matrix. You can use \code{\link[=to_matrix]{to_matrix()}} function to convert your data to
a design \code{matrix}.}

\item{y}{(\code{data.frame} | \code{vector} | \code{matrix}) The response (dependent)
variable(s). If it is a \code{data.frame} or a \code{matrix} with 2 or more columns,
a multivariate model is assumed, a univariate model otherwise. All the
variables are coerced to numeric before training the model.}

\item{method}{(\code{character(1)}) (case not sensitive) The type of model to fit.
The available options are the kernel algorithm (\code{"kernel"}), the wide
kernel algorithm (\code{"wide_kernel"}), SIMPLS (\code{"simpls"}), and the classical
orthogonal scores algorithm (\code{"orthogonal"}). \code{"kernel"} by default.}

\item{components_num}{(\code{numeric}) The number of components to include in the
model. \code{NULL} by default which chooses the best number of components based
on the standard error of the cross-validation residuals heuristic in
univariate models and the maximal number of components in multivariate
models.}

\item{scale}{(\code{logical}) A logical vector indicating the variables in \code{x}
to be scaled. If \code{scale} is of length 1, the value is recycled as many
times as needed. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{validate_params}{(\code{logical(1)}) Should the parameters be validated? It
is not recommended to set this parameter to \code{FALSE} because if something
fails a non meaningful error is going to be thrown. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{seed}{(\code{numeric(1)}) A value to be used as internal seed for
reproducible results. \code{NULL} by default.}

\item{verbose}{(\code{logical(1)}) Should the progress information be printed?
\code{TRUE} by default.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"PartialLeastSquaresModel"} that inherits from classes
\code{"Model"} and \code{"R6"} with the fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{fitted_model}: An object of class \code{\link[pls:mvr]{pls::plsr()}} with the model.
\item \code{x}: The final \verb{\code{matrix}} used to fit the model.
\item \code{y}: The final \code{vector} or \verb{mÌ€atrix} used to fit the model.
\item \code{hyperparams}: A \code{list} with all the provided hyperparameters.
\item \code{hyperparams_grid}: A \code{data.frame} with all the computed combinations of
hyperparameters and with one more column called \code{"loss"} with the value of
the loss function for each combination. The grid is ordered ascendingly by
loss value (the lower the better).
\item \code{best_hyperparams}: A \code{list} with the combination of hyperparameter with
the lowest loss value (the first row in \code{hyperparams_grid}).
\item \code{execution_time}: A \code{difftime} object with the total time taken to tune and
fit the model.
\item \code{removed_rows}: A \code{numeric} vector with the records' indices (in the
provided position) that were deleted and not taken in account in tunning
nor training.
\item \code{removed_x_cols}: A \code{numeric} vector with the columns' indices (in the
provided position and after the design matrix creation) that were deleted
and not taken in account in tunning nor training.
\item \code{...}: Some other parameters for internal use.
}
}
\description{
\code{partial_least_squares()} is a wrapper of the \code{\link[pls:mvr]{pls::plsr()}} function with
It fits univariate models for continuous response variables and multivariate
models for numeric responses only.
}
\details{
You have to consider that before tuning all columns without variance
(where all the records has the same value) are removed. Such columns
positions are returned in the \code{removed_x_cols} field of the returned object.

All records with missing values (\code{NA}), either in \code{x} or in \code{y} will be
removed. The positions of the removed records are returned in the
\code{removed_rows} field of the returned object.
